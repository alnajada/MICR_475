# Bad plot

The following plot is a bad plot in my opinion. The plot represents a growth curve of three different wild type strains in two different substrates.

-   The data shown are continous data. The data (Time) is mapped to the x-axis. The data (optical density OD) is mapped to the y-axis. The y-axis is the log of the OD data, and the data are shown by lines, dots, and cuted lines.

-   In figure A, we can't distinguish between the stranis, one can assume the growth behavior is similar with a little variation during the exponential phase; However, in figure B we can see a variation between them. According to Tufte, clear and detailed data can elimenate distortion and ambiguity.

*How to improve:* use colors, use clear data points with different shapes to differentiate between different data sets.

# good plot

The following plot a good plot. The plot represents a comparison in lipids productions between the original strain and the mutant strain.

-   The data shown are continous data. The data (Time) is mapped to the x-axis. The data (concentration; glucose/lipids) is mapped to the y-axis. The data are shown by lines and points.

-   In both figures, we can clearly see the detaled data sets variations represented by every point in different colors.
