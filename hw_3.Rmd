I was having troubles knitting the file and commit it to github. Also, babynames data is very large it takes my laptop long time to generate the plot, knit, and commit.


```{r}
library(babynames)
library(tidyverse)
head(babynames)

ggplot(data = babynames) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = name, y = year, color = "class"))
```
